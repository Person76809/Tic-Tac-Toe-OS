# Tic-Tac-Toe-OS
a basic implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in Python.  The board is represented as a 3x3 list, and the players are denoted as "X" and "O". The code includes functions to print the board, get player moves, check for a win or tie, and play the game. 

a more robust and extensible version of the shell, you can implement command handlers for different commands instead of relying solely on the `os.system` function. 

In this improved version, command handlers are implemented as separate functions for each command, providing better modularity and extensibility. New commands can be easily added by defining additional functions and adding them to the `COMMANDS` dictionary.

Each command handler performs appropriate error handling and provides meaningful feedback to the user. For example, the `cd` command checks for directory existence and permission errors, while the `ls` command lists the contents of a directory and handles file/directory not found and permission errors.

The shell loop also includes a check for an empty command, skipping the execution to allow for easier command input. Additionally, an `exit` command is included, which gracefully exits the shell when executed.

Feel free to customize and extend this code to fit your specific needs and add more functionality to the shell.

This code defines a simple shell that provides a command prompt where users can enter commands. The `clear_screen` function clears the console screen depending on the operating system. The `show_prompt` function displays the current working directory as the prompt. The `execute_command` function uses the `os.popen` function to execute the entered command and display the output.

The `shell` function creates a loop that continuously prompts the user for commands. It clears the screen, shows the prompt, and waits for user input. If the entered command is "exit," the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the command is executed using the `execute_command` function.

Please keep in mind that this is a basic example and doesn't include the full functionality and complexity of a real operating system. Building a complete text-based operating system requires a deep understanding of operating systems, system programming, and low-level components. It typically involves writing code in lower-level languages like C or assembly and requires expertise in operating system design and implementation.
